microasterismos
===============

Microasterismo is a software made with Openframeworks and Supercollider developed during the Artropocode Residence at Baleiro Lab, in Santiago de Compostela.

It is used for tracking the moles of the body in order to create "microasterisms". It communicates with Supercollider via OSC so it can also create sound.
